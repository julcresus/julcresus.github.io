          Within the scope of my studies in Kingston University, the goal was to analyse a desktop system such as a website or an application and redesign it for mobile devices, using UX principles and the CIF (Common Industry Format) for Usability Test Report. I decided to focus on the PlayStation Store, which, in my opinion, has a lack of consistency between all current platforms. I decided to merge the PlayStation Store and the current PlayStation Messages app and make an application of its time.
